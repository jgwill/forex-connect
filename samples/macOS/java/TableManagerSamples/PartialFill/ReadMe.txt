PartialFill application

Brief
==================================================================================
This sample shows how to process information when an order is executed partially
due to the insufficient market liquidity.
The sample performs the following actions:
1. Login.
2. Create a TrueMarketOpen order for the specified instrument.
3. Wait for it to be fully executed or rejected. Print all order updates.
4. Logout.

Building the application
==================================================================================
In order to build this application you will need Java SDK 1.7 and Apache Ant.
You can download Java SDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
You can download Apache Ant from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Point your command prompt to the current directory and type: 
ant rebuild
For example,
C:\Program Files\CandleWorks\ForexConnectAPI\samples\java\TableManagerSamples\PartialFill>ant rebuild
This will generate directory structure .\build\classes\ and place compiled files there.

Running the application
==================================================================================
Change the build.xml file by putting your information in the arguments section.
For example, if your user name is 'testuser' change the line
<arg line="--login {LOGIN}" /> to <arg line="--login testuser" />.
Point your command prompt to the current directory and type:
ant run
For example,
C:\Program Files\CandleWorks\ForexConnectAPI\samples\java\TableManagerSamples\PartialFill>ant run
This will run the application and display the output on your console.
